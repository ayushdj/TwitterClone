# Twitter Clone

This is a semester-long project where I developed a clone of Twitter's website using modern front and back end technologies. I used React.js, Redux.js, HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front-end, MongoDB to store user data as a back-end and Node.js to allow for communication between the client and the server. The database is deployed on Heroku and the website is on netlify. Feel free to reach out to me for any suggestions you may have for improvement! Also check out the repo "web-dev-node" if you wanna check out the server-side code!
